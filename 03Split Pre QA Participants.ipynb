       "\"Operator\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023.\\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\\nBruce Jermeland\\nThank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Officer. Mike, Kevin and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3 and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\\nMike Roman\\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on the important actions we have been taking to improve our performance and shape the future of 3M. We posted adjusted organic growth of negative 2.5% which includes a negative 1.7% headwind from the expected decline in disposable respirator sales. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range.\\nOur adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, impacted by restructuring charges of $212 million or a headwind to adjusted operating margin of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding these charges, we increased operating margin year-over-year. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion driven by continued improvements in inventory management.\\nToday, we are updating our full year earnings per share guidance to $8.60 to $9.10, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, realize additional benefits from our restructuring actions and position 3M for the future. In the quarter, we maintained a strong focus on serving customers, driving operational execution and maintaining spending discipline. All business segments delivered sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Our restructuring actions and strong focus on cost management drove these margin improvements.\\nLooking at our markets, trends played out as expected. We saw strength in automotive, both OEM and aftermarket, as well as highway infrastructure and personal safety, excluding disposable respirators. Health Care which was up slightly, continues to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related demand, notably in our Biopharma, Health Information and Medical Solutions businesses. We also saw continued weakness in electronics, consumer retail and China.\\nPlease turn to Slide 4. As we focus on improving our performance and managing a dynamic external environment, our teams are driving 3 strategic priorities: improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation. We are on track with our restructuring actions and have made significant progress in leaning out the center of the company, simplifying our management structure and streamlining our supply chain. The changes to our enterprise supply chain organization are enabling improvements in service, cost and inventory which helped drive our second quarter results. We are also taking advantage of the continued healing and supply chains to reduce logistics costs and improve production yields.\\nWe've also made progress in advancing our go-to-market models to bring our innovation closer to customers. In support of these changes, to date, we have initiated the transition to a new export model in 24 countries. I am pleased with how these changes are helping drive performance. We've made good progress on our planned spin of our Health Care business, including regulatory filings and system updates in preparation for soft spin. We are also in the final steps of naming a CEO. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to the required conditions and additional factors we have disclosed in our SEC filings.\\nLast month, we announced an agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve public water systems claims nationwide in the AFFF multi-district litigation. This agreement will benefit U.S.-based public water systems that provide drinking water to a vast majority of Americans. The settlement covers all forms of PFAS. As we announced, we have taken a Q2-related charge of $10.3 billion payable over 13 years. Also related to litigation, we continue to participate in the confidential mediation process as part of the Combat Arms MDL and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\\nTo provide additional details on our PFAS settlement agreement, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Please turn to Slide 5. Kevin?\\nKevin Rhodes\\nThank you, Mike and good morning. This is an important step forward for 3M. As Mike said, we have entered into a broad class resolution with public water systems that provide drinking water to the vast majority of Americans. We are taking a proactive approach to managing PFAS by establishing a more certain path forward for public water systems, communities and 3M.\\nSubject to court approval, 3M has agreed to support PFAS remediation for public water systems that detect PFAS at any level and our agreement addresses all PFAS, not just those compounds that have been the primary focus of litigation to date. Our agreement also provides funding for eligible public water systems that may detect PFAS into the future and we have agreed to fund additional testing by public water systems as well.\\nAs Mike shared, the agreement terms entail a present value commitment of $10.3 billion paid over 13 years. Additional details regarding the payment schedule are available in our Form 8-K filed in June. While this agreement provides an alternative to continued litigation for class members and for 3M, we remain prepared to defend ourselves in litigation should the agreement not receive court approval or should public water systems choose to litigate instead.\\nWe are building on actions 3M has taken and continues to take. We were the first company to exit the manufacturing of 2 forms of PFAS, namely PFOA and PFOS which we announced more than 20 years ago. We have invested in state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations. And we have announced that 3M will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We will continue to build on this important progress as we focus on the future and work to proactively manage PFAS.\\nNow, let me turn it over to Monish to provide more details regarding our performance in the quarter. Monish?\\nMonish Patolawala\\nThank you, Kevin and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Our second quarter performance was driven by continued focus on serving our customers, improving manufacturing and supply chain productivity while also maintaining strong spending discipline. Also, during the quarter, we initiated a large part of our restructuring program to simplify and streamline the organization. We are aggressively reducing management layers and rooftops while also streamlining our go-to-market models and supply chain, bringing us closer to our customers.\\nEnd-market trends continue to play out as anticipated with ongoing weakness in electronics, soft discretionary spending patterns in consumer retail and mixed trends in industrial end markets. Regionally, China's recovery has been slow, impacted by electronics and soft export trends. Europe remains challenged as the uncertain geopolitical situation persists, while end markets in the U.S. largely remain steady.\\nSecond quarter total adjusted sales were $8 billion or down 4.7% year-on-year. This result was a little better than forecasted as we experienced a smaller-than-anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation of minus 0.9% versus a forecast of minus 2%. On an adjusted basis, organic sales declined 2.5% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand. Excluding this impact, Q2 adjusted organic sales declined 0.8%.\\nOn an adjusted basis, second quarter operating income was $1.5 billion with operating margins of 19.3% and earnings of $2.17 per share. These results included pretax restructuring charges of $212 million which negatively impacted adjusted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points and earnings by $0.31 per share. Without the impact of restructuring, second quarter adjusted operating margins were 22% or up 40 basis points versus last year and earnings were $2.48, up $0.03 year-on-year.\\nTurning to other components that impacted results year-on-year; we were able to more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and inflation impacts through improved manufacturing productivity, benefits from restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices while continuing to invest in the business. The net result was an increase to margins of 1.4 percentage points and $0.15 to earnings.\\nThe previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirators resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 50 basis points and to earnings of $0.09 per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $30 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.04 to earnings.\\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 0.9% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 20 basis points to margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, did not impact margins but resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.06 per share year-on-year primarily driven by a lower share count which was partially offset by a lower non-op pension benefit.\\nIn summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending is starting to yield results. These actions, coupled with improvement in global supply chains, drove sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins across all of our business groups. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins improved 3.6 percentage points sequentially.\\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion, up 44% year-on-year with conversion of 122%, up 50 percentage points versus last year's Q2. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory and the timing impact related to restructuring charges. Inventory was flat sequentially versus a typical historical build from Q1 to Q2. We continue to adjust production output to end markets and leverage the power of daily management and data and data analytics to increase the velocity of inventory turns.\\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $328 million in the quarter or similar year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividend. Net debt at the end of Q2 stood at $11.7 billion or down 12% year-on-year.\\nOur business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of Health Care at 3 to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake, will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.\\nNow, please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 4.6% organically; this result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 4.8 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial sales grew 0.2% organically in Q2.\\nOrganic growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket, while personal safety declined due to last year's disposable respirator comp excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically.\\nClosure and masking declined due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity, while industrial adhesives and tapes continue to be impacted by end-market softness in electronics. Adjusted operating income was $614 million or down 2.4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.2%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and up 2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts.\\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10 which posted Q2 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 2.4% year-on-year, largely due to the continued decline in demand for electronics. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 21% year-on-year, approximately 600 basis points higher than global car and light truck builds.\\nOur electronics business continues to be impacted by soft end-market demand for electronics. As a result, this business experienced a year-on-year decline in adjusted organic sales of approximately 22%. Electronic end markets continue to remain highly uncertain. We expect our year-on-year organic growth rates in electronics to remain negative in the second half, however, improve versus down nearly 30% in the first half as we start to lap easier comps.\\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics; transportation safety grew high single digits organically, while commercial [indiscernible] digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $369 million in adjusted operating income, down 19% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.8%, down 3.6 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased 3.1 percentage points sequentially. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\\nLooking at our Health Care business on Slide 11; Q2 sales were $2.1 billion with organic growth up slightly versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up low single digits year-on-year and Medical Solutions business grew slightly. Separation and purification and Health Information Systems declined mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. These businesses continue to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand and ongoing stress on hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve, hospital budgets stabilize and we work through post-COVID-related impacts, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business.\\nHealth Care's second quarter operating income was $411 million, down 16% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19.8%, down 2.8 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased sequentially 1.9 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\\nFinally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending on hardline categories remains soft. We expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year. Organic sales grew slightly in home, health and auto care, while home improvement and stationery and office businesses both declined. Consumer second quarter operating income was $235 million, down 5% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year but up 3.2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volumes, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\\nThat concludes our remarks on the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year expectations. During our January earnings call, we highlighted that we expected macroeconomic and end-market uncertainties to continue to persist into the year. In addition, we noted that we were starting to see the healing of supply chains. However, we expected to continue to see headwinds from raw material availability and inflation, although at a lower level than 2022.\\nWe also stated that we were not satisfied with our performance and we would be taking a deeper look at everything we do as we continue to prepare for the spin of Health Care. As a result, we noted that as we move through the year, we would be taking additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us closer to our customers.\\nWhile we have more work to do, let me take a moment to provide a few examples on the progress we have made through the first half of the year. Starting with our sales performance. While end markets continue to play out as expected, Q1 and Q2 revenue was slightly above our expectations. Our teams continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers, work down backlogs and leverage the use of data and data analytics to drive improvements in demand planning.\\nNext, as we have mentioned, we are aggressively addressing structure. We are on track with our actions to reduce structure across the company, including at corporate, in our business segments and in manufacturing supply chain. We have initiated the transition of 24 countries to an export model, partnering with local distribution to serve those customers and markets.\\nIn addition, we have made good progress in reducing corporate structure, including the exit of our aviation operations and our conference center in Northern Minnesota. And finally, we continue to adjust our production levels to end-market trends, manage inventory and aggressively control spending. As a result of our actions, along with improvements in global supply chains and raw material availability, we are able to deliver first half performance better than anticipated, particularly for margins, earnings and cash flow.\\nIn the first half of the year, on an adjusted basis, we delivered sales of $15.7 billion, operating margins of 18.6% and earnings per share of $4.14. These results included $264 million in pretax restructuring charges or a headwind to margins of 1.7 percentage points and to earnings of $0.38 per share. In addition, our strong operational execution and working capital management, particularly inventories, helped us to deliver $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with a conversion rate of 105%.\\nTurning to guidance; we are raising our full year adjusted earnings expectation as a result of our strong first half operational execution as evidenced by an improving margin rate. We now expect full year's earnings in the range of $8.60 to $9.10 versus a prior range of $8.50 to $9.\\nWe continue to closely monitor end-market trends across all our businesses, particularly in electronics, consumer retail, industrial and China and have yet to see signs of improvement in trends. Therefore, we currently see organic growth tracking to the lower end of our range of flat to minus 3%. This reflects our performance to date along with our year-on-year headwind from disposable respirators tracking to the high end of our anticipated range or down approximately $550 million along with continued macro and end-market uncertainty. And finally, our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion expectation remains unchanged in a forecasted range of 90% to 100%.\\nLooking ahead to the third quarter; we expect end-market trends to be very similar to Q2. Hence, we anticipate third quarter adjusted sales to be approximately $8 billion. The impact from the COVID-related decline in disposable respirators and last year's exit of Russia is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind to sales of approximately $130 million or 1.5 percentage points.\\nThird quarter pretax restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $175 million with pretax benefits of $125 million to $150 million. Taken together, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40.\\nTo wrap up, we continue to have a strong focus on serving our customers, improving the execution in our supply chain, making progress in our restructuring actions, managing costs and investing in the business while navigating ongoing end-market weakness. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and improve our organic growth, margins and cash flow performance into the future.\\nI want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I am confident in our future. As we have said, as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M.\\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\""
